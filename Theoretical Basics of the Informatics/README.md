# Letter Counter

This is just a basic program, that automates counting letters and whitespaces in the text instead of doing it manually via Microsoft Excel.

Important Note: You have to put your text in "input.txt" file, which has to be in the same directory with letter_counter.py. If you make a typo in the name of the file or simply put it in the wrong place, the program will throw an exception and will be immediately terminated, so be careful. 

Another note: "output.txt" file with the result of executing the program will be generated automatically in the same directory your program is executing.
